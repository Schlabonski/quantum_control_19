    "In this exercise we will simulate the Hamiltonian of a three-level system coupled to light fields, given on sheet 9, eq. (2) with $\\hbar =1$. We will explore how a clever arrangement of two light pulses can coherently transfer population from the ground state $\\ket{g_-}$ to the ground state $\\ket{g_+}$. Experimentally, the Rabi frequencies $\\Omega_C$ and $\\Omega_S$ can be controlled by varying the intensity of the light fields. In the case of an atom moving through two gaussian laser beams (signal and control), each Rabi frequency would depend on time as\n",
